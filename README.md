# Weather-Script
A weather app using the requests library to fetch data from a weather API and the rich library to display the data in a nice format.

# Developer Aser

I created this script for fun but it turned out to be a useful script Now i don't have to search for weather in Google chrome! I just have to run this beautiful script and it will tell me the Weather. Have fun and try to edit the script and make it better.

# God is good!
